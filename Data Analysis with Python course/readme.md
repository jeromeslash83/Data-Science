This are the codes done from my data analysis with python course in FreeCodeCamp. Most of the notebooks here are modified for my personal fun and enjoyment. You can still use some of the code for reference if you like but most of it is unusable it you add this code to your project in FreeCodeCamp.

Enjoy!
